\section{Similarity Measures}

\begin{Definition}
  The following document dependent factors appear in many different similarity measures~$\mathcal{S}$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $f_{d,q}$ is the \defi{term frequency}{Term Frequency}. It counts the number of times, word $q$ appears in document~$d$.
    \item $F_{D,q}$ is the \defi{document frequency}{Document Frequency}. It counts the number of distinct documents from~$D$ containing~$q$ at least once.
  \end{itemize}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}
  The \defi{Okapi BM25}{Okapi BM25} similarity measure is given by:
  \begin{align}
    \mathcal{S}_{Q,d}^{BM25} = \sum\limits_{q \in Q}
    \frac{\left(k_1 + 1\right)f_{d,q}}{k_1\left(1 - b + \frac{n_d}{n_{avg}}\right) + f_{d,q}}
    \cdot f_{Q,q} \cdot
    \ln\frac{N - F_{D,q} + 0.5}{F_{D,q} + 0.5}
  \end{align}
  Here $n_d$ is the length of document $d$ and $n_{avg}$ is the average document length.
\end{Definition}

There are several other possible ideas to build a similarity measure:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Documents can be assigned \defi{static weights}{Static Weighting}. An example is the Page-Rank algorithm.
  \item A \defi{language model}{Language Model} can be used to compute the probability to generate the query using the text statistics of each document.
  \item In a \defi{vector space model}{Vector Space Model} we compute the cosine of the angle in $\sigma$-dimensional space between a query vector and a document vector.
  \item \defi{Zone ranking}{Zone Ranking} weighs words appearing in the title of a web page weigh more than words in the body.
\end{itemize}
