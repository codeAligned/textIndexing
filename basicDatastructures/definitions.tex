\begin{Definition}
  Let $\Sigma = \{0, \ldots, \sigma - 1\}$ be a finite, ordered set. The elements of $\Sigma$ are called \defi{characters}{Character} or \defi{symbols}{Symbol} and $\Sigma$ is called an \defi{alphabet}{Alphabet} of size $\sigma$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}
  A \defi{string}{String} $S$ is a sequence of characters from an alphabet $\Sigma$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We usually use $n = \vert S \vert$ to be the length of the string.
    \item The $i$-th character of $S$ is $S[i]$. Indices are $0$-based.
    \item The substring from the $i$-th to the $j$-th character is $S[i..j]$.
    \item A substring with $i = 0$ is called \defi{prefix}{Prefix}. A substring with $j = n - 1$ is called \defi{suffix}{Suffix}.
    \item The $i$-th suffix is $S[i..n-1]$.
  \end{itemize}
